# CSE Capstone Project Template


This begins your capstone development effort.  You will use GitLab as your primary repository for code and documentation.  In these early phases, you may not be delivering 'working software' but you will be delivering just enough documentation to show an understanding of the product in order to communicate a high-level understanding of the product, objectives, scope and quality requirements.  The issues and boards can also be used to collaborate on research.  For those of you on an R&D project, issues are a great way to track each research question.  The comments and team collaboration build a large body of knowledge during your efforts. 

Regarding this readme.md file, ultimately you will update this page to reflect your project and assist anyone who has access to your repository.


# Read these articles
Read the following articles to familiarize yourself with Gitlab and how you will be expected to use it during your project.

* [How to use GitLab for Agile Software Development](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/03/05/gitlab-for-agile-software-development/). 
* [How to Write a Beautiful and Meaningful README.md*](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-write-beautiful-and-meaningful-readme-md-for-your-next-project-897045e3f991#:~:text=It's%20a%20set%20of%20useful,github%20below%20the%20project%20directory.) - buidling your ReadMe file 
* [Always start with an issue](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/) - This article discusses issues and how to use them to collaborate.  Several issue and merge templates are provided in the .gitlab/issue_templates and .gitlab/merge_request_templates.  These should facilitate collaboration and quality. Feel free to edit them to fit the needs of this project.

# Time Tracking

Time tracking is required.  It's very simple.  There are other useful actions like /done, /assign, /approve and /wip to name a few.

| cmd | purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| /estimate | in the issue description, document the initial work estimate in days, hours, or minutes |
| /spend | in the comments for the issue, indicate how much time you spend working at that time | 

Here's the link to [Quick Actions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html).  

# Branches

This project templates includes 2 branches to start with.  

| **Name**   | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Master         | Protected branch.  You cannot push directly to master.  This branch should be what you push to your test server (ceclnx for example) or other devices for your client to review. |
| . . .          | Thereafter, you should follow the code management strategy defined and agreed upon by the team.  I recommend a branch from master for each sprint or interval.  From the sprint-branch, I recommend branching by issue.  Throughout the sprint, rebase your issue branch regularly especially begore a commit.  If an issue is incomplete during the prescribed sprint, commit it to the next spring branch.  This approach gives the master branch an additional degree of protection. |
